# Mental_Health_Sex_Min_Czechia

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the mental health of sexual minority (SM) individuals in Czechia. 
Specifically, we aim to estimate (1) the prevalence rate and (2) the relative risk of common mental disorders, 
and (3) the mental distress severity among the Czech SM individuals, when compared with the heterosexual population. 
In addition, we aim to investigate the treatment gap for mental disorders and the help-seeking behavior of SMs in Czechia. 
We hypothesize that SM individuals would show an increased risk of anxiety disorders, depression, suicidal thoughts and behaviors, 
and an increased mental distress severity when compared with the heterosexual population. We hypothesize that the most affected SM 
group would be bisexual individuals, followed by lesbian or gay individuals (i.e., bisexual then lesbian or gay, and then heterosexual).
